<h2>Intro</h2>
<p>The following is a true story that describes my purchase of a motor vehicle from Premier Subaru of Branford, CT in October 2014, and the fallout that occurred over the next few months. The issue at hand concerns a single tire. This story is being told not to recoup any loss, or costs, but to share a story of what I feel is unethical and dishonest treatment of a customer. I hope my words here can prove to be valuable information to you while considering a large financial commitment, such as purchasing a car.</p>
